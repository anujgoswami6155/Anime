            <p>
                Anime, a distinct style of animation originating from Japan, began in the early 20th century, influenced by Western cartoons. 
                Its roots trace back to the 1910s with pioneers like Ōten Shimokawa and Jun’ichi Kōuchi creating short, hand-drawn films. 
                After World War II, anime started evolving rapidly, especially through the work of Osamu Tezuka, who introduced cinematic storytelling and created Astro Boy in 1963, setting the standard for modern anime.

                The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of genre-defining series like Mobile Suit Gundam and the growth of shōnen and shōjo anime. 
                By the 1990s, anime began reaching international audiences with globally successful titles like Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, and Pokémon, alongside Studio Ghibli’s critically acclaimed films. 
                In the 2000s and beyond, anime’s popularity surged worldwide through TV syndication, internet fan communities, and streaming platforms like Crunchyroll and Netflix. 
                Today, anime is a global cultural force, celebrated for its diverse storytelling, artistic expression, and passionate fanbase.
